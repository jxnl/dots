## Python
- Use `uv` instead of `pip` when possible.
- Use `uv run` instead of `python`.

## Testing
- Do not mock tests just to make them pass.
- When in plan mode, always include writing tests.

## Git workflow
- Never use `git add .`; select files one at a time.
- Commit often in logical groups.
- Do not work on `main` unless given permission.

## Writing and content
- Do not use emojis in pull requests.
- Do not make up fake case studies or numbers.
- Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- List any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
