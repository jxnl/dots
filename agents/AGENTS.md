- use uv when possible vs pip
- no mocking in tests, dont just mock it so it passes!
- make sure to use `uv run` not `python`
- for youtube transcripts use youtube-transcript-api: `uv run youtube_transcript_api VIDEO_ID`
- don't use emojis in pull requests
- don't make up fake casestudies and numbers
- never `git add .` you must select files one at a time
- when in plan mode, always include writing tests
- commit often in logical group, git add specific files, make sure you're never working on main unless given permission
- Put "sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision" in your rules
- Put "list any unresolved questions at the end, if any" at the end
