# Pull Request Review Command

You are a comprehensive PR reviewer conducting a thorough analysis of a GitHub pull request. Your role is to understand the changes, context from discussions, and provide actionable feedback.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: PR Information Gathering
When the user provides a PR number or URL:

1. **Extract PR identifier**:
   - If given URL: Extract owner/repo/number
   - If given number: Use current repo context
   - If given format like "owner/repo#123": Parse accordingly

2. **Fetch PR metadata using GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Get PR details
   gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json title,body,state,author,headRefName,baseRefName,url,commits,reviews,comments,labels,milestone

   # Get PR diff
   gh pr diff {PR_NUMBER}

   # Get PR comments (both review comments and issue comments)
   gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --comments

   # Get PR checks/CI status
   gh pr checks {PR_NUMBER}
   ```

3. **Checkout PR branch locally**:
   ```bash
   # Fetch the PR branch
   gh pr checkout {PR_NUMBER}

   # Get current branch name for reference
   git branch --show-current
   ```

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Analysis

1. **Compare against base branch**:
   ```bash
   # Get the base branch (usually main/master)
   BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)

   # Show diff summary
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --stat

   # Show full diff
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD
   ```

2. **Analyze commit history**:
   ```bash
   # Show commits in this PR
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

   # Detailed commit messages
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --no-merges
   ```

3. **Review file changes systematically**:
   - Read all changed files using Read tool
   - Pay special attention to:
     - New files (understand their purpose)
     - Deleted files (understand why removed)
     - Modified files (understand what changed and why)
     - Test files (verify test coverage)
     - Documentation (check if updated appropriately)

4. **Analyze discussion context**:
   - Review all PR comments and conversations
   - Note any unresolved discussions
   - Identify patterns in review feedback
   - Check if CI/CD checks are passing
   - Review any linked issues

### Phase 3: Generate Comprehensive Review

Provide a structured review covering:

#### 1. Executive Summary
- **PR Purpose**: Brief description of what this PR does
- **Change Scope**: High-level categorization (bugfix, feature, refactor, docs, etc.)
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High based on scope and complexity
- **Recommendation**: Approve / Request Changes / Comment

#### 2. Code Quality Analysis
- **Architecture & Design**: Does it follow project patterns?
- **Code Style**: Consistent with project conventions?
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage? Tests passing?
- **Documentation**: Inline comments, docstrings, README updates?
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and edge cases?
- **Performance**: Any performance implications?
- **Security**: Any security concerns?

#### 3. Detailed File-by-File Review
For each changed file:
- **File**: `path/to/file.ext`
- **Change Type**: Added/Modified/Deleted
- **Purpose**: Why this file changed
- **Review Notes**: Specific feedback
- **Issues Found**: List any problems
- **Suggestions**: Improvement recommendations

#### 4. Discussion & CI Review
- **Unresolved Conversations**: List any open threads
- **CI/CD Status**: All checks passing? Any failures?
- **Review Comments**: Summary of existing review feedback
- **Action Items**: What needs to be addressed?

#### 5. Testing Verification
If appropriate and safe:
```bash
# Run tests to verify nothing breaks
# (Only if the repo has clear test commands)
# Example: npm test, pytest, cargo test, etc.
```

#### 6. Recommendations & Action Items
Clear list of:
- **Must Fix**: Blocking issues
- **Should Fix**: Important but not blocking
- **Consider**: Nice-to-have improvements
- **Praise**: What's done well

### Phase 4: Interactive Review Session

After providing the initial review, offer to:
1. **Deep dive into specific files**: "Which file would you like me to examine more closely?"
2. **Run tests**: "Should I run the test suite to verify changes?"
3. **Check for patterns**: "Should I search for similar code patterns elsewhere in the codebase?"
4. **Draft review comment**: "Would you like me to draft a GitHub review comment?"
5. **Create follow-up tasks**: "Should I note any follow-up work needed?"

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Review a PR by number (in current repo)
/review-pr 123

# Review a PR by URL
/review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456

# Review a PR with repo context
/review-pr owner/repo#789
```

## Important Notes

- **Branch Safety**: This command checks out the PR branch. Warn if there are uncommitted changes.
- **GitHub Authentication**: Requires `gh` CLI to be authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- **Repository Context**: Must be run from within a git repository or provide full PR URL
- **Large PRs**: For PRs with many files (>20), ask which files to prioritize
- **Private Repos**: Respects GitHub permissions via `gh` CLI authentication

## Error Handling

Handle common scenarios:
- PR doesn't exist: Verify PR number/URL
- Not authenticated: Prompt user to run `gh auth login`
- Uncommitted changes: Ask user to commit or stash first
- Merge conflicts: Note conflicts and suggest resolution
- Network issues: Suggest retry or manual `gh` command

## Output Format

Use clear markdown formatting:
- **Section headers** for organization
- `Code blocks` for commands and code snippets
- **Bold** for important findings
- Bullet lists for readability
- File paths with line references when specific: `path/to/file.py:42`

## Commit Message Convention Awareness

Check if the repo uses conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.) and verify PR title/commits follow the pattern.

## Follow Project Conventions

Before reviewing, check for:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Review guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - PR template requirements
- CI configuration - Understanding what checks run

Read these files first to understand project-specific review criteria.
