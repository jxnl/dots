# Creating Your First Draft

Create presentations using a content-first approach. Focus on structure and flow before adding polish.

## Philosophy

**Content first, polish later.** Get your material right before adding animations or visual enhancements.

## First Draft Approach

- Focus on your story and the flow between slides
- Use the simplest layouts that keep ideas readable
- Draft speaker notes as you go—capture the full thought, not just a bullet
- Skip click animations and polished code blocks until the structure feels solid

## Workflow

1. **Structure first** - Outline your presentation flow
2. **Write content** - Fill in slides with actual content
3. **Add speaker notes** - Write detailed notes as you create slides
4. **Review flow** - Ensure narrative makes sense
5. **Stop here** - Don't add animations yet

## When to Stop Drafting

Stop drafting when:

- Your narrative is complete and flows well
- All slides have content
- Speaker notes are written
- Structure feels solid

**Then:** Move to [POLISHING.md](./POLISHING.md) to add animations and enhancements.

## Using Components During Drafting

**Allowed:**

- `QRCode` - Can be used for end-of-slide CTAs

**Not allowed:**

- `Callout`, `Chart`, `FileExplorer`, `Terminal` - Save for polishing phase

## Syntax Reference

While drafting, use [BASICS.md](./BASICS.md) for:

- Slide separators and frontmatter
- Basic layouts (two-cols, center)
- Simple code blocks
- Basic components (QRCode only)

## Key Principle

Don't try to perfect everything at once. Build the material first, then enhance specific slides that benefit from animation.
